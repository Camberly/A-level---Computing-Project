# A-level---Computing-Project
My a level computer science programming project where I developed an algebraic calculator using the programming language C#.
The projects' main feature is it's calculator that works in basic algebra and can complete other basic mathematical methods, such as differentiation.
It can also hold data at a local level about users, this offline storage is achieved through the use of basic SQL and a database. To use this functionality, users are able to register an account and from that point they are able to login to the software, this allows quizzes' progress within the app to be tracked, so they can see how they did in a particular topic.
